Fortunately (or unfortunately), a lot of jobs in the field don't actually require a degree to get into, especially at the entry level. Some may require a portfolio of your past work (writing, design, film reel, etc.), others may just seek the right attitude and people/analytical skills.\n",

This also means that there are elitists in our society who may look down upon the field and its graduates. Of course this doesn't apply to everyone - I've met some genuinely passionate and committed students.\n",

      "THE only person wearing a smile when the Selangor state assembly Speaker dismissed the need for the Selat Klang seat to be vacant was its assemblyman Datuk Abdul Rashid Asari. Abdul Rashid could not hold back the jubilant tone when he jumped to his feet to thank Speaker Lau Weng San while the opposition erupted in protest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Speaker, aware that it was not a popular decision, quickly adjourned the sitting and made a swift exit. It was not his proudest moment on the hot seat where he has been out of his depth against a fortified opposition led by Hulu Klang assemblyman Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali. It was also not a good day for Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Johari Abdul because his argument for not declaring the six parliament seats vacant came across like a glass of weak teh tarik - not enough milk or sugar and too diluted to swallow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outrage from the opposition bench in Parliament was more dramatic with Perikatan Nasional MPs making emotional speeches and staging a walk-out. Both Speakers won the battle for the ruling coalition but they might have lost the war of public opinion. The actions of the Bersatu elected representatives who defied their party by throwing their support to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim have not gone down well with the thinking populace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision of the two Speakers to “save” them from having to face by-elections has been described as a mockery of the anti-hopping law that was passed in 2022. But that is the name of the game - the quest for political survival should never be underestimated. It is easy to preach about reform and democracy when in the opposition but it is a different song and dance once in power.\n",
      "\n",
      "A well-placed Putrajaya source said the Pakatan Harapan’s top brass had been agreeable to vacating the seats but were waiting for the Sungai Bakap by-election to be over. Umno pushed hard for it after their groundwork showed they had a good chance of winning in Kuala Kangsar, Gua Musang and Labuan, three of the six parliament seats that Bersatu took with narrow majorities in 2022. There was a real chance of Umno taking away seats from Bersatu or at least giving it the fight of its life.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Perikatan’s increased majority in Sungai Bakap triggered alarm bells. It shocked those in the coalition, with one MP who had been on the campaign trail saying he was “heartbroken”. The anti-hopping law was born from the initiative of Pakatan leaders who made it one of the conditions when they signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Transformation and Political Stability with then prime minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob in 2021. As such it was ironic to see several MPs from the government bench defending the Speaker’s decision and basically defending the actions of the Bersatu MPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are facing a crisis of confidence. Losing more Malay-majority seats would reinforce the reality that the government does not enjoy Malay support. The unity government is still struggling to gain the trust of the Malays, to convince them that it can deliver for them,” said political commentator and lawyer Ivanpal Singh Grewal. In hindsight, then minister Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said’s proposal for a recall provision in the anti-hopping law ought to have been taken more seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recall provision would have required the Election Commission to hold a referendum among a certain percentage of the constituency’s voters to let them decide whether to retain or reject the MP. There would be no need for a more costly by-election if they choose to retain the MP. However, Azalina, who is Pengerang MP, stressed that the anti-hopping law is to prevent MPs from jumping but should not be used against those who exercise their constitutional rights to speak out or adopt stands contrary to their party leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bersatu leaders have essentially accused the Speaker of reinterpreting their party constitution. If Bersatu turns to the courts for a solution, things may dangle on till after the three-year deadline for by-elections upon which the matter will die a natural death. The decisions of the two Speakers come with political costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Speaker as an arbiter needs to be fair. I understand the government is in survival mode but the reasons given by both Speakers to not vacate the seats do not make any legal sense. “What happened has further chipped away at the progressive and reformist image of Pakatan. It has become a hostage of realpolitik, unable to practise the values that it preached when it was the opposition,” said Ivanpal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question that needs to be asked is: Did Pakatan really need to backtrack on the anti-hopping law by associating with what people on social media are calling frogs, turncoats and traitors? The Prime Minister is sitting on a supermajority in Parliament. He has the biggest numbers that any government has had in more than a decade. His government did not need the support of the six MPs who are a hindrance rather than an asset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the by-elections proceeded and even if Umno managed to win only one seat, it would have boosted morale while dealing a massive blow to Bersatu. Umno would be crowing and strutting like a cockerel throughout the kampung. Instead Pakatan chose not to rise to the challenge, decided to play it safe and lost the moral high ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been pointed out that this debacle is a creature of Pakatan’s own creation. There had been accounts that these Bersatu MPs were enticed with promises of allocations for  their constituencies if they supported the Prime Minister. And like a movie which has lots of twists and turns, one thing led to another and it has come to this messy moment. More Pakatan leaders will likely step up to defend Bersatu MPs in the coming days but they should not overdo it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very few thinking people approve of what the two Speakers did because frogs do not belong in Parliament or the state assembly.\n",

Despite there only being one instance of the paddle object, my plan was to still create a Paddle class that inherits from the GameObject class. I guess my first question is is that okay to do when you're only going to have one instance? And then I guess my second question would be, if it's okay to do that, how exactly would the constructor look like for that class? And how exactly would I define the traits of the paddle? Like for example, I'd want my paddle to be red, so would I put something like:\n",

From there, within 2 nested \"for\" loops, I have a line `Grid[(i,j)] = (Long,Lat)`, which I would think would do what I want, but it's throwing an error about float() arguments?
